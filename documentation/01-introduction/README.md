## Product Management

### Catalogs

A [catalog](https://learn.liferay.com/w/dxp/commerce/product-management/catalogs) contains all the information about the products youâ€™re selling. Before starting a store, you must create at least one catalog and add products to it. Catalogs are scoped to an instance.
